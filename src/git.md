## Common Tasks

### Creating and downloading a repository

Change directory to the place where you want to create your repository.
`git init [project-name]` Creates a new local repository with the specified name.

Alternatively you can got to [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and create the repository online.

To start using a remote repository it needs to be clone locally.

## To reset to origin/master

```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Note:
    This will delete files that are not in git.

### Explanation

git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or re-base anything.

Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master, so if you have any local changes, they will be lost. With or without --hard, any local commits that haven't been pushed will be lost.
